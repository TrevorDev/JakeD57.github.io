	<p> Welcome to the ultimate guide to wicked grub in the 6. This is my personal food blog, <br>
	and will explicitly cover all the top food joints in Toronto. Every weeek I will post a new <br>
	food joint and review it. The grub will reside on all ends of the food spectrum, haburgers, pizza<br>
	deserts, pastsa, chicken and so forth. This blog will be co-written with my brother Mr. DRstylez.<br>
	We have a comprehensive rating sytem consisting of 3 categories. Quality, service and Price.</p>

	<p>Good old reggies. This place right here is what I like to call a hidden gem. Tucked away in<br>
	a random neighbourhood, out of sight. A delicious combinaiton of pizzahut style cheese with dominos<br>
	crust. Tether that with affordable prices, this has come to be one of myself and DRstylez favorite<br>
	places to muck some zaw.Reginos Pizza gets a solid average score of 3.6. Mr DRstylez encountered a <br>
	very bad customer experiance one time which hurt the overal score tremendously</p>
